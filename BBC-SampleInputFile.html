<h1>Coronavirus: Remembering 100 NHS and healthcare workers who have died</h1>

<p>Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers.

The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic.

Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS.

Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work.

Here are 100 of their stories.
